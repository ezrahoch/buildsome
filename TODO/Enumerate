* Python listdirs the current dir, must fix ls

  * Need to enumerate all existing patterns.

  * This is only possible for targets where each wildcard on the left
    side (outputs) also appears in the right-side (inputs)

  * Template instantiations need to be silo'd in their own
    subdirectory instances/ that never gets listdir'd

* Enumerate pattern targets:
  * Enumerate FilePattern inputs as Matches
  * Instantiate patterns with matches

* Enumerate FilePattern inputs as Matches:
  * Glob files that match the FilePatterns
  * Find targets/patterns that match the FilePatterns:

    Need to find all patterns, in dir/, that match: foo_%_bar
    e.g:  foo_zag_%, %, f%, ...
